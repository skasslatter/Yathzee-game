# Yathzee-game

Intoduction:

Yahtzee is a dice game I built in week 3 of my Ironhack bootcamp in Amsterdam. The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations and dice must remain in the box.

Used technologies:

JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML
